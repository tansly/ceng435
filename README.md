# CENG435 Term Project

Term project of CENG435, Data Communications and Networking course. (METU, Fall 2018)

The project consists of two parts:
* Part 1: We implemented an unreliable data transfer protocol over UDP and
measured experimental end-to-end delay values of the protocol under certain emulated
network conditions in the GENI platform.
* Part 2: We extended the protocol to be a reliable data transfer protocol, inspired
by the RDT specification described in Kurose, Ross (Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach).
We measured the transfer time of a file using our protocol under lossy and unreliable
network conditions in the GENI platform.
